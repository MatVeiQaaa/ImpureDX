![unrandomizer](https://github.com/MatVeiQaaa/ImpureDX/blob/main/.github/images/unrandomizer.png)

This is a collection of whatever features i may come up in the future for Beatmania IIDX INFINITAS.
Currently it only has unrandomizer as its feature. Works for all P1, P2 and DP, when arrange type is in "RANDOM" mode.
